Criteria B: Design
=======================

### Early Design

**Fig. 1:** An initial design sketch of the program and its various pages. This was made after the first meeting with the client in which criteria for success were laid out.

**Fig. 2:** The first rendition of the user interface for the program. While it is not functional, it is a good impression of what the program would look like. It features the five different screens as outlined in figure 1: home, check in, check out, maintenance, and records. 

## Consulation with Client

After the first rendition of the user interface for the program, I consulted with my client to see what possible changes could be made. They did not have any major changes they wanted except for the color being changed. The evidence for this interaction can be found in the [appendix.](https://github.com/rikiod/unit3/blob/master/appendix.md)

# 2nd Version of Design

**Fig. 3:** The second rendition of the user interface for the program. After consulting with my client, the colors were changed and her name was added to the top of each window. 

# Design Changes

Due to a lack of developmental tools and time crunch, the maintenance function was removed after a consultation with the client. The client says "we don't perform maintenance that often," and as such, the function is not entirely necessary. 

In addition, since the main capability we had learned related to the table widget, the designed had to be changed in order to focus on one page with a main editable table. This still is able to fulfill most of the requirements and is quite user-friendly; however, it is a large change.

**Fig. 4** The third and final rendition of the application. It has been trimmed down to only a home page. There is no login necessary for this application because the user wants it to be accessible to everybody.
