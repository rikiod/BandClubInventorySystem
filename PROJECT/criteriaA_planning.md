Criteria A: Planning:
=====================

### Definition of Problem:

The client in this scenario faces an issue in that it can be difficult to keep track of her musical instruments at school. She has a total of fourteen instruments in two different locations and because they are shared with other members of her school's community, it is easy to lose track of them. She wishes that she had the capability to see that if somebody checked an instrument out, she could see their name, the time they checked it out, the expected return time, what exactly they took, and for what purpose. If the person did not return the instrument by the expected return time, she also wishes that the system would send her a reminder. Lastly, it can be difficult to remember when maintenance may be required for her instruments at times. Her exact problem, as written by the client, can be found in her [design statement](https://github.com/rikiod/unit3/blob/master/designStatement.md) as well. 

### Proposed Solution:

To solve this issue, I propose creating an inventory system with all of my client's musical instruments. The program will enable my client to track the usage of her instruments and ensure they are being used to her liking. It will be housed on her personal computer. 

This program will be coded in Python because of its status as a commonplace coding language and because we are currently learning it in class. Its accessible syntax and extensive resources makes it a great language to code with. GitHub is also being used for this project because it allows for easy documentation of code and communication with the client. 

**To see if this proposed solution is feasible or not, I assessed it using the TELOS acronym.**

*Technical:* A simple inventory system such as this does not require a lot of processing power and as such, it is technologically feasible. 

*Economic:* Since this system will be housed entirely on a local device, it does not require a lot of additional resources and is economically feasible.  

*Legal:* There are no legal ramifications of an inventory program such as thus and as such, it is legally feasible. 

*Operational:* Since there are currently no operational procedures put in place, it will be quite easy to transition to this program -- it is operationally feasible. 

*Scheduling:* Due to the lack of a urgent necessity for this program, there is no strict schedule. Additionally, this inventory system should not take a particularly long time to create, and, as such, it is feasible in the schemes of scheduling.  

**Criteria for Success:**

The following success criteria were discussed and approved by the client as seen in the [appendix.](https://github.com/rikiod/unit3/blob/master/appendix.md) It is important to note that communication will be sustained with the client in order to see if any of her needs change and, as such, the success criteria need to change as well. 

1. Must have time stamps so check out time can be recorded.
2. Must have capability to have purpose instrument was taken.
3. Must have name-recording capability 
4. Must have capability to track at least 15 instruments
5. A reminder message will be sent when an instrument is checked out for too long (2 days)
6. Must have capability to see when instrument was last "checked up" on so that they stay in good condition.
