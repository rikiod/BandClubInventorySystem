Criteria D: Evaluation:
=====================

### Success Criteria:

While most of the success criteria were met, there are still two which have not been.

### Possible Improvements:

Firstly, the two most improvements would be adding a maintenance capability and a reminder email. These two weren't possible at the time because the reminder email would require an email sending capability which is unclear. Besides that, the finished application works well and is user friendly. Some issues that it may pose, however, could be the lack of security. It is able to be edited by any user, but my client says that she trusts the users and that a log in capability is unnecessary, so it will probably be fine. Besides that, aesthetic improvements could be made since the application is quite plain and dominated by the table. Perhaps using drop down menus to fill the table in instead could be helpful. 

If time constraints were gone, the table could certainly be made more user friendly. Adding the capability to add more rows (currently, 20 instruments can be recorded) and also adding a "records" function would be nice as well.
