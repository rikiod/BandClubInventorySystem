Developer: "I have seven different success criteira and I just wanted to run them by you to see what you think if this would really help us to see if our program is working.

Client: Alright.

Developer: So our first one is, I noticed you seemed to really care about the time so it's going to have time stamps for the check in and check out.

Client: Mhm.

Developer: Do you think that's necessary or no?

Client: What does time stamp mean?

Developer: It'll record the time.

Client: Good, amazing. Continue.

Developer: And then its going to have the capability to record the purpose for an instrument being taken. So, if somebody takes it to play it or to break it, they can write that down.

Client: Yeah, yeah, okay.

Developer: And then it'll record who took it or they'll enter their name.

Client: Mhm, mhm. And email.

Developer: Okay. And is it necesarry that they all have accounts so they need to sign in or can they just write dwon their names?

Client: That's such a good idea. 

Developer: Probably the latter, right?

Client: Yeah.

Developer: And its going to have a capability of 15 instruments. Is that enough, or more?

Client: That's pretty much it.

Developer: And then, a reminder message will be sent out when its checked out for too long.

Client: Yes, please.

Developer: How long do you want that to be?

Client: Like ten minutes. Maybe like, twenty.

Developer: Okay, okay.

Client: What's your suggestion?

Developer: Well, I thought they take it and bring it home or something.

Client: Well, make it like...

Developer: Two days?

Client: Yeah.

Developer: And lastly, it'll have a capability to see when the instrument was last maintained so if you replace the strings or something, you can put that in the record.

Client: That's incredible. Oh wait, i need something else. Can you create a black list because there are certain people that can't borrow it.

Developer: So would that just be a list that displays on the side?

Client: I think that's better. 

Developer: Alright, thank you so much.
