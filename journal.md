Unit 3 Journal
==============

**Wednesday, January 29th:**

  Today, we had an introduction to Python. We talked about our "wish list" for a programming language which included things such as few brackets/spaces, flexible syntax, documentation/comments, functions, variables, data types, printing, logical comparisons, libraries, control structures, and more. We then talked about how to do these sorts of things in Python and talked about the following data types:
  1. Integers
  2. Lists
  3. Floats/doubles
  4. Strings
  5. Tuples
  6. Dictionary
  
   From there, we applied these and practiced a few programs before ending class learning about "bubble sort," an important sorting mechanism.
   
**Wednesday, February 5th:**

  We learned that this next unit will have two projects (one desktop app, one web development -- both in Python).
  1. Computational Thinking needs to be shown in the development (decomposition --> pattern recognition --> abstraction --> computational thinking) explicitly. 
  2. We did a warmup: given ten integers, find the largest prime factor. 
  3. We created a library which we will fill with important functions.
  4. My client is Lingye and my task is to create a library of musical instruments. 
  5. My PyCharm client isn't working properly so a question I have is how to fix that.
  
**Tuesday, February 11th:**

  We started with a warmup about finding the distance between various cities and through this, we learned how to extract tuples from lists. We also defined a function called distance in myLib.py.
  Following that, we established a record of tasks in order to see what steps need to be taken to create our client's program for Unit 3. Using that, we began the first step which is planning. We had an interview with our client (in my case, Lingye) and I learned about her needs (see RecordOfTasks.md).
  
  Next time, I think I need to start working on establishing what Lingye's needs are in terms of usability.

Today, we started with a warmup called "Bolt versus Cheetah" and learned about acceleration and velocity, converting it to a time given the distance covered. We used math functions such as sqrt and practiced doing mathematical equations using variables. 

We then worked on calculating the average salary of a group of people within revealing their personal information and practiced with the reduce function. We used encryption by creating a salt and then hashing it using a separate function. This makes it so that the password can not be seen easily. 

For next class, I need to update my Record of Tasks, designStatement, and continue developing the log in/registration system. 

**Friday, February 14th:** 

Today, we practiced with strings using a book called "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python." It was a good way to learn about split, join, and a whole bunch of other commands which can be seen in the stringMan.py file under warmups. 

For the next class, I need to continue practicing these commands so that I have a good grasp on their syntax and usage. 

**Monday, February 17th:** 

Today, we began with a programming warmup without a laptop; it helped me to learn how I need to continue practicing in order to hone my syntax. After that, we did a Kahoot on the physical parts of a computer which was interesting and good review over memory and other things. Lastly, we met with our client to talk about the success criteria which can be seen in the Criteria A section and the Record of Tasks file.

We received a homework assignment to find an instance where software is used in a profession other than computer science. I completed it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gt_9hkmF0L5PYeJT3UFmFP-p79ow_6mxtqde2v8eZLA/edit#slide=id.p). We were also told to practice with strings as we may be given a homework on Classroom. Lastly, I want to practice more with Python in general in order to improve my skills.

**Wednesday, February 19th:**
   
Today, we went over our homework assignment which was essentially to graph different functions using Python (see classroom). It was interesting because we learned a new way to graph a sine function, adjusting the length of its step, without using an additional library. From that, we presented our slides on the software a profession uses (I found the one on genetic engineering interesting) and did a Kahoot on software/applications.

After that, we began our project of developing a "bank account" program which can be found in this repository. Currently, it only has the ability to check balance, deposit, and withdraw. For next class, we have an assignment on Classroom which I need to work on and I'd like to read one chapter from the book, "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python."

**Monday, February 24th:**

Procedural Programming:
Object-oriented programming (OOP): describing the world using objects, their roles, and their interactions. 
GUI: graphical user interface

what'd we do, what'd we learn, what questions do i have?

We worked on OOP and basic design sketches. I learned a lot about classes and instances; however, I still have a lot of questions about how to actually institute this in a useful program. I also am still not clear on application, but that should be cleared up with the homework. 

new vocabulary (in glossary): data structure, primitive data structure, instance, user defined data structure

hw: oop worksheet; bring sketches of application
