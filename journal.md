Unit 3 Journal
==============

**Wednesday, January 29th:**

  Today, we had an introduction to Python. We talked about our "wish list" for a programming language which included things such as few brackets/spaces, flexible syntax, documentation/comments, functions, variables, data types, printing, logical comparisons, libraries, control structures, and more. We then talked about how to do these sorts of things in Python and talked about the following data types:
  1. Integers
  2. Lists
  3. Floats/doubles
  4. Strings
  5. Tuples
  6. Dictionary
  
   From there, we applied these and practiced a few programs before ending class learning about "bubble sort," an important sorting mechanism.
   
**Wednesday, February 5th:**

  We learned that this next unit will have two projects (one desktop app, one web development -- both in Python).
  1. Computational Thinking needs to be shown in the development (decomposition --> pattern recognition --> abstraction --> computational thinking) explicitly. 
  2. We did a warmup: given ten integers, find the largest prime factor. 
  3. We created a library which we will fill with important functions.
  4. My client is Lingye and my task is to create a library of musical instruments. 
  5. My PyCharm client isn't working properly so a question I have is how to fix that.
  
**Tuesday, February 11th:**

  We started with a warmup about finding the distance between various cities and through this, we learned how to extract tuples from lists. We also defined a function called distance in myLib.py.
  Following that, we established a record of tasks in order to see what steps need to be taken to create our client's program for Unit 3. Using that, we began the first step which is planning. We had an interview with our client (in my case, Lingye) and I learned about her needs (see RecordOfTasks.md).
  
  Next time, I think I need to start working on establishing what Lingye's needs are in terms of usability.  
  
**Wednesday, February 12t:h**

Today, we started with a warmup called "Bolt versus Cheetah" and learned about acceleration and velocity, converting it to a time given the distance covered. We used math functions such as sqrt and practiced doing mathematical equations using variables. 

We then worked on calculating the average salary of a group of people within revealing their personal information and practiced with the reduce function. We used encryption by creating a salt and then hashing it using a separate function. This makes it so that the password can not be seen easily. 

For next class, I need to update my Record of Tasks, designStatement, and continue developing the log in/registration system. 

**Friday, February 14th:** 

Today, we practiced with strings using a book called "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python." It was a good way to learn about split, join, and a whole bunch of other commands which can be seen in the stringMan.py file under warmups. 

For the next class, I need to continue practicing these commands so that I have a good grasp on their syntax and usage. 

**Monday, February 17th:** 

Today, we began with a programming warmup without a laptop; it helped me to learn how I need to continue practicing in order to hone my syntax. After that, we did a Kahoot on the physical parts of a computer which was interesting and good review over memory and other things. Lastly, we met with our client to talk about the success criteria which can be seen in the Criteria A section and the Record of Tasks file.

We received a homework assignment to find an instance where software is used in a profession other than computer science. I completed it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gt_9hkmF0L5PYeJT3UFmFP-p79ow_6mxtqde2v8eZLA/edit#slide=id.p). We were also told to practice with strings as we may be given a homework on Classroom. Lastly, I want to practice more with Python in general in order to improve my skills.

**Wednesday, February 19th:**
   
Today, we went over our homework assignment which was essentially to graph different functions using Python (see classroom). It was interesting because we learned a new way to graph a sine function, adjusting the length of its step, without using an additional library. From that, we presented our slides on the software a profession uses (I found the one on genetic engineering interesting) and did a Kahoot on software/applications.

After that, we began our project of developing a "bank account" program which can be found in this repository. Currently, it only has the ability to check balance, deposit, and withdraw. For next class, we have an assignment on Classroom which I need to work on and I'd like to read one chapter from the book, "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python."

**Monday, February 24th:**

Procedural Programming:
Object-oriented programming (OOP): describing the world using objects, their roles, and their interactions. 
GUI: graphical user interface

what'd we do, what'd we learn, what questions do i have?

We worked on OOP and basic design sketches. I learned a lot about classes and instances; however, I still have a lot of questions about how to actually institute this in a useful program. I also am still not clear on application, but that should be cleared up with the homework. We also looked at the maxima of a graph; however, that was also confusing. We will learn more about that next class. 

new vocabulary (in glossary): data structure, primitive data structure, instance, user defined data structure

hw: oop worksheet; bring sketches of application 

**Wednesday, February 26th:**

Today, we learned about creating a basic UI using OOP. We downloaded QtDesigner and then created a "bitcoin converter." We were then able to convert this graphic UI to a Python script and add our own individual objects. While we finished the UI, we did not finish the stage of adding our own objects. I'm curious as to how we will proceed with that step.

HW: Create user interfaces using QtDesigner for all of the screens in your application sketch from last class. 

**Monday, March 2nd:**

Today, we met with our client to go over the QTDesigner UI we have created. We also learned about how to code a UI using classes, as done with the example of currency conversion. 

**Friday, March 6th:**

The past week, we have been working on coding practice and studying for the upcoming test after spring break; however, today, I also worked on updating my documentation as here in GitHub and further practicing coding through CodingGame. [Here](https://github.com/rikiod/unit3/blob/master/CodingGamePuzzles.md) are my solutions to the CodingGame problems. 

**Monday, March 9th:**

We began today's class by working on coding our UI. We imported all of our UI files as Python files and then consolidated their classes into one main file called MainApplication.py. I learned that when importing files, they are taken from the outer most file, and as such, they must be found by going into the subfolders. Besides that, I learned that the image must be put into an image folder inside of the main project folder in order to be imported correctly. 

We learned the term "modality" and its subterms non-modal, window modal, and application. Non-modal means that the window can be closed (regular windows), window modal means that the window cannot be closed, and application modal means that one window must be done before any other windows are used (ex. press OK to continue to the next window).

I also learned that the additional windows need to be created as dialog boxes, not main windows. Otherwise, it is not possible for the application to work. Something I need to prepare for next class is to change my window modality for the check in.

**Wednesday, April 8th (Week 28):**

This week's programming practice was good since I had forgotten some basic syntax over spring break. They were not too difficult. 

I like the syllabus questions since I feel like we haven't practiced those sorts of questions very much and I need to practice them more. 

**Tuesday, April 14th (Week 29):**

This week's programming practice was definitely a lot harder than the previous week; however, I thought it was good practice. The syllabus question was nice as well, but I liked the style of last week's more.

Regarding the Unit 3 project, I worked more on the graphic aspects and trying to see how to work on the tables since I don't have a log in system. 

**Tuesday, April 22nd (Week 30):**

This week, we were supposed to think more about our IA. I was thinking about issues I could possibly work on at home here in the US, but decided that it would probably be easier to go with a problem at ISAK. I'm now brainstorming ideas of issues that could be solved here at ISAK (currently thinking about some sort of package mangement system for the main office?). 

We also did some practice with OOP programming, getting our directions from a word problem. I found this pretty similar to just the normal directions. 

**May 1st (Week 31)**
 
I finished up the Unit 3 Project development and evaluation. I first had a lot of questions about the table functionality and drop down menus, but decided to completely redesign the application in order to rest solely on the use of a table. This made it easier to get done; however, I had to research a lot about saving that information to a database and such. Besides that, I did the screen recording as well and feel as though I better understand the IA criteria. 

**May 8th (Week 33)**

This week, we began Unit 4.
