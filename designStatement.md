Design Statement
================

### My role as a developer:

I am going to design an inventory to keep track of my client, Lingye Wu's, various musical instruments. The application, to be operated on a computer, will help my client to keep track of where her instruments are and who has them currently. This is important because currently, people often take her instruments and it is easy for her to lose track of where they are. Thus, I will essentialy be creating a sort of "check out" system. 

**Questions to be answered:**

① What are the inputs, outputs, and how will those inputs be processed?

② What is the purpose of this system?

③ What is a current issue with your legacy system?

④ How comfortable do you feel with new systems or technologies?

⑤ Is security important to you? Does your system need to be able to be easily edited?

**Lingye's Answers:**

"I store my instruments in two locations (house and small cafe). The problem is that people from R3-12 take instruments. I use my phone the most. Since I have multiple of one instruments, maybe we could number them. It does not need to be able to be easily edited and security is not very important to me."

The inventory system I am looking for is for my musical instruments. I usually keep them in two places: my house(R1-14) and the small
cafeteria. I am now faced with two problems: 
1. The different kinds of instruments have different materials, therefore require a certain cycle of checkups and repairment, which I 
find hard tracking by memory since I have too many instruments.
1. I am open to people borrowing my instruments while I need to know:
    1. Who took it
    1. When did they take it
    1. When is the expected return time
    1. What exactly did they take
    1. For what purpose did they take my instrument
  
1. Here is the list of instruments I have:

  Small caf | R1-14
  ---|---
  Piano | Bass guitar
  Hand drum | AMP1
  AMP2 | ELectric guitar
  Jazz Drums | Guitar Picks(5)
  Drum sticks (4) | Capo
  Wire(2) | Wire(1)
  Sheet music | Guitar bags(2)

1. I want to be able to:
    1. Send a reminder message when the person borrowed my instruments forgot to return
    1. The program only accessable to myself

### My needs as a client:

Currently, I have all of my clothes stored under my bed here at ISAK. However, with the residential living that we have here, my clothes sometimes can get easily lost or moved around. My clothes constantly moves between different areas on campus such as my campus, the shower room, the washing machine, drying racks, other houses, or to Asama and KAC. Because of this, it has been easy for me (especially with socks) to lose track of my clothes; over the last semester, I've noticed my clothes dwindling as some of them disappear. 

As such, I need a program which would be able to help me keep track of where my clothes is -- I would want to be able to, for example, see if my clothes was in the wash or if it was just clean and folded in my closet. I'd also want it to only be accessible by me; however, security isn't a vital aspect for me. Lastly, the main way I differentiate between my clothes is what they are (shirt, pants, shirts, etc.), their brand, and their color.
